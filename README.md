## General Info

I started this portfolio in October of 2021. The design is going for a delicate and bold theme with soft colors alongside dramatic graphics and lines. The code is as simple as a website can get with just HTML, CSS, and Javascript files. The entire project was a nice refresher of the little coding skills I had at the time. The design is responsive and mobile first. .
The deployed website is [here]( https://portfolio-three-sandy-75.vercel.app/) .
